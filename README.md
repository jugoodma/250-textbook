## Compilation

```
https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html
https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html

sudo apt install biber

make
```

Interesting tool: `apt-file -x search '/algpseudocode.sty$'` (if you're using the old `texlive` installed from `apt`)

## Progress

`done` should be taken with a grain of salt. They are "done" as a draft.

* `done` Intro
* `done` Logic
* `done` Set Theory
* `done` Number Theory
* `done` Combinatorics and Probability
* `done` Functions and Relations
* `8/10` Countability
* `3/10` Graph Theory
* `5/10` Asymptotic Analysis
* `4/10` Conclusion

Need to figure out how to compile each chapter individually.

Also, maybe re-structure Number Theory chapter. It's really long
